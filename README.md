============

The main application example for my upcoming book "Learning AngularJS for .Net Developers"

You need to use Visual Studio 2013 to load the "src\RentThatBike.sln" file and run the project.
The application was built sequentially and has three main sequences: building the client side part with AngularJS, building the web service services part with ServiceStack, and the putting it all together part with AngularJS, ASP.NET MVC and ServiceStack.
